# Retrospective - Theme Builder App

## What was the outcome?

1. To share your app with the group, first walk us through the original goal and what you ended up making.

I wanted a simple one page app with colour pickers that changed the value of CSS variables (which were then visually reflected on the site). I then wanted a way for the user to have a way to "save" their changes and use them elsewhere.

In the end I had just that, using the Agregore theming, the "save" functionality came in the form of a button which downloaded the CSS (albeit in a crude form it feels).

2. Did you accomplish more or less than the original app idea? If you started out with a user story, were those aims accomplished?

I pretty much got everything I wanted done for the app. I did have a "user story" which was essentially describing my apps basic goal. So yes, the aims were accomplished.

3. Did the idea evolve or change drastically through the process? If so, how did these changes affect the outcome?

It didn't really, no. While ideas for like, "stretch goals" came up I really wanted to focus on something basic since this was the first time I'd ever developed anything in an environment like this and I was a little rusty in general.

## What was the process like?

1. Describe making the app. Link to the tutorial here.

Making the app was interesting! I guess it wasn't too eventful, the tough part was trying to figure out what my dev environment was going to be like.

2. What else was notable about the process? Some discussion questions:

- What went well?
  - The overall process felt pretty good! I got into a decent rhythm with it and it felt like what I had to do next was pretty clear.
- What took a lot of time?
  - The most time consuming thing was dealing with the p2p hosting, my experience with making p2p web apps were small "hello world" type apps and so I didn't know best practices in terms of how to connect files together. (Like having an image or using a css/js file instead of it all being in one big HTML file). In the end I decided not to deal with it this time around. But hopefully I can try it out for my next app.
- Did you find anything else to be unexpected about making the app?
  - Can't think of anything for this one.
- If you could give yourself advice when you started making the app, what would you tell yourself?
  - Probably to be flexible. I spent way too long thinking about how I was going to do something a specific way when I could have just done it. Apps are not unchangeable, if I did something "wrong" I could simply fix it later or make note of it for the future.

## Discussion

1. What would you do with this app if you kept working on it? E.g. future improvements? Demo it with users (if so, who would the users be)?

As it is right now, it's very barebones (which I think is good!) I think I'd like a way to load themes into it that a friend provides (to emphasize sharing themes around) and I'd like a way to like, have saved themes be on the site and loadable so you can have multiple themes to switch between (so like, imagine there are swatches on a sidebar which you can click on and then the site turns into that theme, and you can add more themes to that, I dunno if that describes it very well). I wonder too if I could merge these things into a "theme shop" kinda thing but like, not a shop!

I also was thinking about adding more customization to things, like maybe you want more theme colours than the 4 currently provided, or you want to use serif fonts for headers but sans-serif for the rest of the site. I think there is a point or a line somewhere where someone should just learn CSS? But I do think there is some usability in a *little* more customization.

2. If any technical improvements to Agregore or the underlying protocols could make development easier for this app, please describe them here.

Can't think of anything at the moment.
