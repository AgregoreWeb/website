<h3>What is the distributed web?</h3>
<p>
  The current web works by having companies set up servers which host people's websites and data.
  This means that if a company goes down, or if a person doesn't have access to their server (say they're offline, behind a firewall, or can't afford a decent connection) they can't access it.
  This also means that not everybody can publish things since it takes a lot of technical know-how to host things that they can have full control over.
</p>
<p>
  The distributed web works by removing central web servers and instead using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer">Peer to Peer connections</a> directly between people to load data.
  If you want to create something, you serve it directly from your computer, and when somebody downloads their content they will also re-share it.
  The more people load some data, the more resilient it is and the faster it can be downloaded.
</p>
<p>
  As well, once you've loaded some data over the distributed web, you no longer need to be connected to the internet to access it.
  In fact, if you have a bunch of people connected to a wifi router in the middle of nowhere, your peer to peer apps will all keep working.
</p>
<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>
  Agregore works by letting you load web pages and content from peer to peer protocols the same way you would load them from a website.
</p>

<p>
  In the same way as you can navigate to <code>http://example.com</code>, you can navigate to <code>hyper://blog.mauve.moe</code> and have it load from anybody on the network that has a copy.
  This can be done via the different protocols that Agregore supports like <a href="https://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0003.html">BitTorrent</a>, <a href="https://ipfs.io/">IPFS</a>, and <a href="https://hypercore-protocol.org/">Hypercore Protocol</a>.
  The web contents are rendered via Chromium using the <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/">Electron framework</a>.
  Electron is useful since it's what allows us to publish Agregore on Windows, MacOS, and Linux.
</p>
<h3>How do I share stuff?</h3>
<p>
	Agregore not only supports loading data through custom protocols, but it also provides APIs for uploading data into peer to peer protocols.
	This is done via the browser's <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/fetch">fetch()</a> API which is what web developers use to talk to web servers over HTTP or HTTPS.
</p>
<p>
  You can create your own peer to peer website using this simple code snippet:
</p>
<pre>
// Upload your website page
await fetch(&#x27;hyper://example/index.html&#x27;, {
  method: &#x27;post&#x27;,
  body: &#x60;&#x3C;h1&#x3E;Hello World!&#x3C;/h1&#x3E;&#x60;
})
// Navigate to the website
window.location.href = &#x27;hyper://example/&#x27;
</pre>
