## Extensions - Agregore Browser

Here's some info about how to use web extensions in Agregore Browser.

### Installing extensions

Agregore doesn't yet support loading extensions from app stores or zip files, but you can place the extracted extensions inside a folder for it to load.

Click on `Help > Open Extension Folder` in the application menu on any window to open up your extensions folder.

You can drop folders in here to have them load when Agregore starts up.

For a list of APIs that are supported, please look at the [Electron Extensions](https://github.com/sentialx/electron-extensions/issues/14) module.

### Built in extensions

Agregore comes with a few built-in extensions.

- [UBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/) is a secure ad blocker which makes your default experience on the web a bit safer.
- [ArchiveWeb.page](https://archiveweb.page/) lets you create local copies of websites and either save them to IPFS or as files.
- [Agregore Renderer](https://github.com/AgregoreWeb/extension-agregore-renderer) renders Markdown/Gemini/JSON as well as a "Reader Mode" which extracts the main contents from a web page and renders it with your browser-wide color scheme.
- [QR Share](https://github.com/AgregoreWeb/extension-agregore-qr-share) is a minimal QR code generator and scanner so you can share P2P website links without dictating long strings of letters and numbers.
- [Agregore History](https://github.com/AgregoreWeb/extension-agregore-history) is used by Agregore to track and search through your web browsing history. You can fork and update it to do whatever yopu want without needing to upgrade Agregore as a whole.
