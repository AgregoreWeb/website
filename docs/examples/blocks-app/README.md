Blocks
======

A personal app launcher/bookmarking tool. To begin, [visit the app](https://agregore.mauve.moe/docs/examples/blocks-app/) and click the "Save Blocks" button. This will create a copy of the app and save it to your Agregore browser.

Add your links to the app and they'll automatically save to your own copy on
IPNS. You can then send your IPNS link to your friends, and they can start adding or removing links into a copy of their own.
