# llm-lenses-chat
Simulate what it's like to be misunderstood by translating what you meant to say in real time

## How it works

- Forked from Agregore's [LLM Chat example](//agregore.mauve.moe/docs/examples/llm-chat.html)
- Before text is sent to the LLM it is translated by a prompt to an LLM
- Users can configure the "tonal lense" they wish to apply to the message
- This simulates what it's like to be misinterpreted by others
