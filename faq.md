If you think there's more that we should have on here please [open an issue on github](https://github.com/AgregoreWeb/website/issues/new).

### What are the differeneces between Hypercore, Bittorent and IPFS?
+ [<ins>Bittorent</ins>](https://bittorrent.org/) is the oldest out of the three and has the most data. However it does not support files that change over time.
+ [<ins>Hypercore</ins>](https://hypercore-protocol.github.io/new-website/guides/getting-started/) is fast and allows files to change, but it only is available in Javascript.
+ <ins>IPFS</ins> is not very strong with files that change but it does have some basic support unlike Bittorent.

When peers use **Bittorent** or **Hypercore** to share data, they are seperated by the websites and can't share connections between websites. Where as in **IPFS** you can download data regaurdless of which website it is apart of. In other words, Bittorent and Hypercore find peers per website while IPFS finds peers per file. This also means that IPFS needs more resources to advertise and look up data.
